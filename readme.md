This branch contains the maps and ride files from other folks.
`master` has the scripts used to generate this data.

### adding new maps
It's a bit broken, really..
`master` has the actively developed map and js.
Any changes to this have to be manually fed to each map.
Though changes to player.js should trickle down as each page hotlinks to the repo's copy.
I really need a template or a real backend..
